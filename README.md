## users & posts
A simple iOS application in Objective C showing a scrollable list of users and posts when selecting one.

Two UITableView drawn into a storyboard, a datamodel (*User, Address, Company, Post*) and Services (*UserManager, NetworkManager*) are available in that project.

You will also found UnitTest and UI Tests, that will check the code is working fine.
